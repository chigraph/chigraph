# What is chigraph?
Chigraph,  pronunced chai-graph, is a new systems programming language. It's fast. It's scalable. And, more importantly, it's easy to learn. How does it achieve such goals? By scrapping the age-old standard of text (not entirely though). Here's a screenshot from [the Qt5 GUI](https://github.com/chigraph/chigraph-gui):

> **NOTE**
> This is the repository for the chigraph language. If you are looking for the interface that goes along with it, see https://github.com/chigraph/chigraph-gui

# Components
Chigraph is made up of three components:

## chi
chi is the command line interface to chigraph. It lets you compile and run chigraph modules:
```bash
$ pwd
~/chigrpah/src/
$ chi get github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph/hello/main # download it
$ cd github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph/hello/main
$ chi run main.chimod # run it
Hello World!
```

## libchigraph
libchigraph is the chigraph library that provides all functions for chigraph clients, like code generation, graph representation, etc. Want to compile a chigraph module using libchigraph? ([documentation](https://chigraph.github.io/chigraph/))

```C++
#include <chi/Context.hpp>

int main() {
    chi::Contxt myContext{"/path/to/workspace"};

    // download and load the module
    myContxt.loadModule("github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph/hello/main", chi::LoadOptions::FetchDependencies);

    // compile it
    llvm::Module* mod;
    myContxt.compileModule("github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph", &mod);
}
```

And tada, you have yourself a [`llvm::Module`](http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/classllvm_1_1Module.html) to do whatever you wish to. It'll have all it's dependencies linked in and a main function waiting to run.

## libchigraphdebugger
libchigraphdebugger is a library that makes it easy to implement chigraph debuggers. See [the `Debugger` documentation](https://chigraph.github.io/chigraph/classchi_1_1Debugger.html) for more details.
